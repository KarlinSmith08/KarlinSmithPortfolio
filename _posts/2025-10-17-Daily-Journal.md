This is the journal of almost every working day I had during this class.

September 26, 2025: I had my first visit to the Atrium Carolina's Rehabilitation Center in uptown Charlotte. I went with Caroline, Marisol, and Scarlett, the girls who are also working on the projects for Atrium. We toured their assistive technology lab and were able to see a lot of the current devices they are using. Then we took a tour of their gym on the first floor and met one of their patients "Jordan," a 23 year old male who has issues walking and tremors due to a stroke, and we were able to see him practice walking across the gym with a walker. We then toured the gym on the spinal and brain trauma floor and met a 21 year old we call "Shaq" whose spinal cord was severed after he was shot in the back. We discussed with the nurses what kinds of devices they were already using and what needed to be improved. 

October 6th, 2025: While visiting Atrium's rehabilitation center, I had been personally requested to create more mouthpieces for the hospital's "sip and puff" controller techonology called the "[Quadstick](https://www.quadstick.com/)". The OTs and PTs were forced to use the same mouthpieces as the patients just becuase there were so little available. On this day, I found a file for the quadstick mouthpieces to begin printing it out.

October 7th, 2025: I was able to find a narrow and a wide model of the moutpieces with 3 holes, as well as a narrow and a wide model with 4 holes. I create a file with all four varaitions and can now mass produce these mouthpieces, and the rehab center can as well once they have their own 3D printers with this file.

October 8th, 2025: I printed two sets of all four mouthpieces. One I tested by seeing how all four holes were connected to holes at the bottom of the moutpiece that would connect to the technology of the Quadstick itself. 

October 10th, 2025: I started researching methods on how to attach a water bottle holder to a wheelchair. I discovered that using a holster similar to a bike water bottle holder would work best. I then moved on to designing and researching the best waterbottle and straw attachment. 

October 17th, 2025: Work on Github personal portfolio.
