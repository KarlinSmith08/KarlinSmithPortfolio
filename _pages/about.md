Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Karlin Smith and I am a Senior at Charlotte Latin School. There are just a few things you should know about me. I have one younger brother named Harrison who is currently in 9th grade. I am a competitive swimmer at MAC and spend over 22 hours in the pool every week. I have been at Charlotte Latin School since kindergarten. I am the leader of Swim Across America's Junior Advisory Board. My favorite subject is currently biology. I am verbally committed to swim for Bucknell University and I will be joining the class of 2030 in the fall of 2026! I have taken engineering classes at CLS since Freshman year. Before my Senior year, we documented using GoogleSites. Every documentation for each class is linked below.
