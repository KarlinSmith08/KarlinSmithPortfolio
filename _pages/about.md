Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Karlin Smith and I am a Senior at Charlotte Latin School. There are just a few things you should know about me. I have one younger brother named Harrison who is currently in 9th grade. I am a competitive swimmer at MAC and spend over 22 hours in the pool every week. I have been at Charlotte Latin School since kindergarten. I am the leader of Swim Across America's Junior Advisory Board. My favorite subject is currently biology. I am verbally committed to swim for Bucknell University and I will be joining the class of 2030 in the fall of 2026! I have taken engineering classes at CLS since Freshman year. I took Intro to Engineering Freshman year, Civil Engineering and Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering my Sophomore year, Electrical Engineering (Honors) and Biomedical Engineering (Honors) my Junior year, and Advanced Engineering (Honors) my Senior year.
